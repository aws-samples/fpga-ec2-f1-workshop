This is a level 300/400 workshop for chip engineers with experience on ASIC/FPGA design, and who want to get hands-on experience with AWS FPGA development using EC2 and EC2 F1 FPGA cloud instances, and all the related tools for FPGA development in the cloud.

{{% notice info %}}
Background knowledge of C and Verilog are required to successfully complete the workshop

The workshop consists of a number of lab modules, each designed to demonstrate a number of FPGA development concepts on AWS.

After creating an FPGA design (also called CL - Custom logic), developers can create an Amazon FPGA Image (AFI) and easily deploy it to an F1 instance. AFIs are reusable, shareable and can be deployed in a scalable and secure way.
