**Need to ask for an increase in instance limit for f1 instances.** By default, your AWS Account will have an EC2 F1 Instance launch limit of 0. Before using F1 instances, you will have to open a [Support Case](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create) to increase the EC2 Instance limits to allow launching F1 instances.
